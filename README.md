# CLI-App
In this app you we have interacted with different api's to do different searches. In this app you can use the following commands to
do different actions. The different commands for different actions in this app are: "spotify-this-song", "movie-this" and "concert-this".

Now if you want to look up a song all you have to do is type in the command "spotify-this-song" followed by the song name that you would like to search, 
which after the command is active with a song title, it will then return information about that song.

If you would like to look up concerts that are happening with a band simply use the command "concert-this" followed by a band name which, in return
will give you the bands concert events happening soon.

And last but not least, if you want to look up information for a movie then you would use the command "movie-this" followed by the movie title and
in return will bring you back information about that movie.
